# OSU CS-475 Parallel Programming Project 1

Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the range of outcomes for a series
of parameters, each of which has a probability distribution showing how likely
each option is to happen. The goal is to check the runtime of the simulation
with both 1 and 4 threads.
