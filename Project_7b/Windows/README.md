# OSU CS-475 Parallel Programming Project 7b

This project uses auto-correlation of random values to find a sine wave
and uses OpenMP, SIMD, and OpenCL to measure their relative performance
at the same task. This version has been altered to return results on my
personal Windows 10, Intel xeon w3680, Nvidia GTX1060 6GB system.
