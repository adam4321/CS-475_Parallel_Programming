# OSU CS-475 Parallel Programming Project 7b

This project uses auto-correlation of random values to find a sine wave
and uses OpenMP, SIMD, and OpenCL to measure their relative performance
at the same task. This version is tested and working on Oregon State
University's Linux engineering server which includes Intels GPUs.
